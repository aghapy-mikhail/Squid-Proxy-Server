Squid: Optimising Web Delivery

Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. Squid has extensive access controls and makes a great server accelerator. It runs on most available operating systems, including Windows and is licensed under the GNU GPL.


Squid is a Linux-based proxy application. The Squid proxy server is used for filtering traffic, security, and DNS lookups.

Also, Squid can speed up a web server by caching resources. The Squid Proxy allows a server to cache frequently visited web pages. When the user requests a web page or file, the request goes directly to the proxy server — an intermediary device between the user’s device and the internet. The proxy server pulls up the resources and relays them to the user.

node-http-proxy vs Squid: What are the differences?

node-http-proxy: A full-featured http proxy for node.js. node-http-proxy is an HTTP programmable proxying library that supports websockets. It is suitable for implementing components such as proxies and load balancers; Squid: A caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. Squid reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. Squid has extensive access controls and makes a great server accelerator. It runs on most available operating systems, including Windows and is licensed under the GNU GPL.
